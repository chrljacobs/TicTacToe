# TicTacToe
A TicTacToe program with a perfect AI (minmax with alpha beta pruning). It will always win or tie on a 3x3 board. Works on a 4x4 board, but can lose.
On a 4x4 board, if the user knows the solution, then second player (the computer) has no chance to win. There is no option for the player to go second because it is boring. When going first, the AI uses minmax, searches the entire board, and ultimately decides that it has an equal chance to win from any point on the board, and always places it's character in the bottom right corner. Since it never changed, I removed the choice of going second.
I created this program as a project for an AI class.
